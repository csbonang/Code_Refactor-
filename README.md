# Code_Refactor-
# Requirements 
1. source code includes semantic HTML elements (MOSTLY DONE) 
2. structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning (?)
3. image elements includes alt attributes (DONE)
4. heading attributes fall in sequential order(?)
5. title element has a concise, descriptive title (?)
# Questions 
1. My heading attributes are currently spread out. Am I using my headings correctly? 
2. Was I suppose to use a title element? I did not see any in the develop code. I suppose I could use it for some of the headers. If so, where? 
3. In my style.css. do you want all sections in one class or in seperate?  (+) cleaner/shorter code (-) diff to change each section
